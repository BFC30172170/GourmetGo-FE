# GourmetGo Front End

GourmetGo is a Proof of Concept application for a mock food delivery app showcasing features of a Rich Internet Application (RIA) and Progressive Web App (PWA)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Getting Started

To experience the full application capability the front-end should also be run in conjunction with this and can be found here: [GourmetGo_Server](https://github.com/zgl112/GourmetGo_Server)

### Prerequisites

Node is Required to run this project. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) version 20.9.0 recommended
bash is recommended to run basic scripts. gitbash for windows can be downloaded from here: [gitforwindows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

### Installation

To clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, install the dependencies and run the project, run the following in a bash terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/BFC30172170/GourmetGo-FE.git
cd GourmetGo-FE
npm i
npm run start
```

To create and serve a production build from within the project directory run the following in a bash terminal

```
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```
## React Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
